# Nunus

**Nunus for NYTimes Browser Extension**

Nunus helps you find what’s new on the New York Times front page since you last checked.

**What it does**

When you revisit the NYTimes front page, Nunus automatically grays out any article titles you have already seen on the front page, so new stories stand out immediately.

**How “already seen” is defined**

Whether you actually click to view an article is unimportant.  A title counts as seen as soon as the title appears for a few seconds on the front page. Even if the title changes a bit, it will still be marked as seen, as long as it links to the same article. If the same title appears more than once on the page, all later occurrences are grayed out immediately.

**Keyboard shortcut**

Press Option + ↓ (Mac) to jump straight to the next unseen title on the page.

**Typical use case**

You read the Times over breakfast. As a news junkie, you check back in the afternoon. Most of the stories are the same — but several new ones have been added during the day. With Nunus, everything you have already seen is grayed out, so the new stories are immediately visible without any scanning.  
This is especially useful on the weekend, when the Times frequently recycles articles from earlier in the week or even from previous weeks. Nunus grays those out too, so you only spend time on what is actually new to you.

## Installation

Install **Nunus** from the official extension listings (normal “add extension” flow —- no unpacked load or zip install).

- **Chrome** (and other browsers that install from the Chrome Web Store): **[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/)** — open the **Nunus** product page and choose **Add to Chrome**.
- **Firefox**: **[Firefox Browser Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/)** — open the **Nunus** product page and choose **Add to Firefox**.

**Firefox 128+** is required (`strict_min_version` in `manifest.json`).

**Safari (your own Xcode build):** After you create the Safari Web Extension target, hook in [`safari/scripts/copy-web-extension-resources.sh`](safari/scripts/copy-web-extension-resources.sh) as described in [`safari/README.md`](safari/README.md) so the `.appex` loads the same files as the repo root.

## Versioning

Uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: A newly supported publication (e.g. adding The Guardian when Nunus was NYTimes-only), or breaking changes (removed sites, incompatible storage format)
- **MINOR**: Improvements within publications already shipped (better detection, new behavior on NYTimes)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and small polish

Use `./scripts/release.sh --major "…"` when enabling a new publication in `manifest.json`. The default release bump is **minor** (NYTimes-only improvements).

## Packaging (Chrome + Firefox)

- **`scripts/newnunus.sh`** — reads `manifest.json` **version**, writes **`../nunus-<version>.zip`** (Chrome Web Store–style) and **`../nunus-<version>.xpi`** (Firefox; runs the same checks as `build-nunus-firefox-xpi.sh`). From your shell:  
  `newnunus() { /path/to/NunusCursor/scripts/newnunus.sh "$@"; }`
- **`scripts/build-nunus-firefox-xpi.sh`** — Firefox **only**; default output **`../nunus.xpi`** (override with **`NUNUS_XPI`**).

Both artifacts exclude `safari/`, `samples/`, `.git`, IDE folders, `scripts/*`, and `*.iml`.

## Release automation

Full release (minor bump by default, commit, tag, push, build, publish):

```bash
cp scripts/release.env.example scripts/release.env
# fill in store credentials, then:
./scripts/check-release-credentials.sh
./scripts/release.sh "short summary of this release"
```

Options:

- `--major` — new publication or breaking change (`1.6.1` → `2.0.0`)
- `--version X.Y.Z` — set an explicit version
- `--dry-run` — preview the bump without changing files
- `--skip-push` — commit and tag locally only
- `--skip-publish` — stop after building zip/xpi/Safari pkg

Each release also increments Apple `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in the Safari Xcode project (all targets stay in sync).

**Credentials** live in `scripts/release.env` (gitignored). See `scripts/release.env.example`.

| Store | What to set | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome | `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`, OAuth client + refresh token | [Chrome Web Store API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/using-api) — enable API in Google Cloud, OAuth consent, one-time auth for refresh token |
| Firefox | `AMO_JWT_ISSUER`, `AMO_JWT_SECRET` | [addons.mozilla.org/developers](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/) → Tools → Manage API Keys |
| Safari (Mac) | `APPLE_TEAM_ID` + App Store Connect API key **or** `APPLE_ID` + app-specific password | [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account) — Team ID; API keys under Users and Access → Keys |

Check readiness: `./scripts/check-release-credentials.sh`

**Safari** builds the macOS `NunusHost` scheme only (not iOS). After upload, finish review in App Store Connect.

## Project structure

- `core.js` - Shared logic (storage, visibility tracking, styling)
- `content.js` - Entry point; dispatches to site handlers
- `sites/nyt.js` - New York Times (shipped in `manifest.json`)
- `sites/washingtonpost.js`, `sites/guardian.js` - work-in-progress handlers (not in the current manifest)

To ship a new publication, create or finish `sites/newsite.js`, register it in `content.js` and `manifest.json` (host permissions, content script matches, and script list), and release with **`--major`**.

## Permissions

See `manifest.json` for the full list (e.g. **storage**, **activeTab**, **scripting**, and site-specific **host permissions**). In short: remembered titles and popup features use **storage**; the extension only injects on the declared homepage URL patterns.
